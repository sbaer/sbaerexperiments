RhinoPython Test Scripts
========================

A pile of work-in-progress (some incomplete) python scripts that I am working on for use in Rhinoceros. Discussions for help on using these scripts can be found at:

* http://python.rhino3d.com/


Get Involved
------------
If you want to tinker with and help complete these scripts, feel free to send me a message on github and we'll try to figure out the best way to make that happen.

You are also welcome to submit bugs and wishlist items for these scripts at https://github.com/mcneel/rhpython_tests/issues

Using the Source
----------------
You are going to need either:

* The latest Rhino5 Beta (http://www.rhino3d.com/nr.htm)
* The latest Mac Rhino WIP (http://mac.rhino3d.com/)

Start Rhino and run EditPythonScript or RunPythonScript. Load and run one of the scripts found in this directory.
